1- what is a broker in this context?

End of questions

What to change:
--> def perform_move(self, coords: CoordPair) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
line 331
TODO implement the attack and heal methods
TODO add a log for all the moves

--> def is_valid_move(self, coords: CoordPair) -> bool:
line 321
TODO verify whether this needs something else or not

End of the things to change

D2

We have the function move_candidates that does looks for all the possible moves that are possible for the player, which will
be a huge help for the task
