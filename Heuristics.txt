e1 = (weight * AIP1 + weight * VP1 + weight * TP1) - (weight * AIP2 + weight * VP2 + weight * TP2)

weight = A number assigned depending on the importance (the AI weight is going to be significantly bigger than the 2 others, respectively 1000, 250 and 250

AIPi = Health points of the AI of player i
VPi = Health points of the viruses of player i
TPi = Health points of the techs of player i

The idea is that all units on the board of a player will use itself to protect their AI since it is an important unit
and its health points are valuable. However, the viruses and the techs are also valuable since they deal and handle
huge damage respectively, therefore, these 2 units wouldn't engage in battles that aren't necessary. Also, the AI would
evade the fighting as much as possible.

--> Viruses would be more violent since their damage maximizes victory
--> Techs would use themselves as shields for the AI as counters to the Viruses for minimizing the damage

e2 = (weight * AMP1 + weight * HP1) - (weight * AMP2 + weight HP2)

weight =  number assigned depending on the importance (To have a lot of available moves is really important which is why
its weight will be significantly bigger than the health points, respectively 300 and 50)

AMPi = Available moves of player i
HPi = Health points of player i

The idea behind this heuristic is to occupy strategic positions that would allow a lot of movements while restricting
the opponent's movements
